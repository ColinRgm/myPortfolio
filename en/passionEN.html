            <p>I discovered web development in mai 2021 and it was a real coup de coeur for me. <br>
                I have started projects in HTML / CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
            </p>

            <p>I've been following the UFC for a little over two years now, I've always had an eye on it but never really got interested in it <br>
                but it's when I met a current colleague who follows this organization closely that I really started to get into it myself.
            </p>

            <p>I've always loved tattoos, from a very young age I told my parents that I wanted to get one too. <br>
                At the age of 18 I got my first one and at 20 I started tattooing as a hobby.
            </p>

            <p>Ice hockey is a great love story in my family, my father played it for many years and it was also the first sport I had the chance to practice at only 3 years old. <br>
                But it's especially the Lausanne Hockey Club that holds the attention of several generations of my family.
